Description: This package provides functions and utils needed for illustrating the examples of imprecise inference presented in the study of Walley (1996) <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02065.x>. Two imprecise models are exercised with multinomial data and 2x2 contingency table data for classroom teaching. The concept of prior ignorance, representation invariance principle, hypothesis testing, decision-making, and further generalization is also exercised.
